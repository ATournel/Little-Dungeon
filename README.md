# *Little Dungeon* Wiki

**Little Dungeon** is a dungeon crawler game only playable on console.

It is written in **Java**.

It uses:  
* Classes  
* Loops
* *if* statements (a lot)
* Randoms

1. Classes

   I used inheritance not to repeat code for similar classes, like Hero class and Foe class both inherit from the Character class.  
   It also has the following classes:  
     - Chest: randomly found after each fight, this class determines wich possible loot to get in a regular or boss chest  
     - Room: 10 pregenerated rooms with 1, 2 or 3 foes in it  
     - BigTexts: where I wrote all the methods containing long texts  
     - Magic: to manage the five different kinds of hero magics in the game  
     - Weapon: to create the equipable weapons for the Hero  
     - Armor: same as Weapon
