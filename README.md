### Welcome to,

# *Little Dungeon* Wiki

**Little Dungeon** is a dungeon crawler game only playable on the eclipse console.

It is written in **Java**.

It uses:  
* Classes  
* Loops
* *if* statements (a lot)
* Randoms
* Scanners

### 1. Classes

   I used inheritance not to repeat code for similar classes, like Hero class and Foe class both inherit from the Character class.  
   It also has the following classes:
   * Chest: class used to create different chest methodes, regular and boss chest  
   * Room: used to create 10 pregenerated rooms with several foes in it
   * BigTexts: where I wrote all the methods containing long texts
   * Magic: to manage the five different kinds of hero magics in the game
   * Weapon: to create the equipable weapons for the Hero
   * Armor: same as Weapon
   * Potion: I created this class to have different kinds of potions(life and mana)
   * Game: the Game class is where all the magic happens, it contains the *main* method
          
### 2. Loops

   Loops are used in this game for repetitive consecutive actions such as generating a trap, followed by a room and then a chest but five times in a row.
   It allows code to be smaller while the user experience gets longer.
   
### 3. *if* statements

   A lot of conditions are used to determine the following actions available to the player.
   That is where the *if*, *else if* and *esle* statements come at use.
   Wether it is to determine conditions of victory/defeat, wich ending to display to the player or even if a player may or may not open a chest, those statements are very handy.
   
### 4. Randoms

   There are a lot of randoms involded. 
   I used them for:
   * Traps: player randomly face a trap when entering a room
   * Loots: foes randomly drop some loot, loot also randomly determined
   * Chest: same as foe loots
   * Rooms: randomly select five rooms between the ten available, rooms may repeat themselves
   * Foes: randomly displays 1, 2 or 3 foes in each room the player visits
   * BossChests: the first one randomly loots a legendary item but the second and third ones loot according to 
   previous loots
      
 ### 5. Scanners
 
   Scanners are used to allow the player to select one the different choices offered to him.
      
 ## That's it for the technical part.
 
 To end this README, I just have one more thing to say.
 
 Please play the game, I hope you will have some fun, I thought of four different endings for you!
 
 Don't hesitate to give me some feedback, you most probably face some balancing issues. 
 Still, I hope you won't...
 
 Again, have fun, and thank you for reading!
